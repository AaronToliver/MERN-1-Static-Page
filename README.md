# MERN-1-Static-Page
M-MongoDB, E-Express, R-React, N-Node. This repository will explain a step by step process of creating a MERN application from scratch. Following repository's will expand from this point. Check the README file for instructions.


# Intro
When building any website, whether it's a simple html/css/js project or a complex application, it's always good to have a gameplan. However, when using stacks like MERN, MEAN etc. It's even more critical to know where to start when you finally sit down and start coding. The file/folder structure for some stacks can be immensely overwhelming. Which file do we begin with? Will we be able to make changes along the way without compromising the rest of the project? How do we manage our imports/exports? The following tutorial will assist in creating a static webpage from scratch with the MERN stack as the focus.

## Before We Begin
This is NOT the first phase in a project. It isn't even the second. It is the first step in the coding phase of the project. I've had to learn that the hard way, and I'd recommend learning from my mistakes. You can save countless hours if you plan as much of your project as you can before getting to this phase. Whether it be on pen and paper, on a whiteboard with collaborators, or anything else, make sure you have at least the following in place: front-end visual concepts, back-end data concepts, and FILE STRUCTURE(<= in all caps for a reason).

# Requirements
Have the following installed.

- Any text editor.
- NodeJs
- Express
- Webpack
- Git Bash (any command line will do. However, I'm used to Git Bash.)

# Step 1: Starting Your Project
 Open up your command line and cd into the folder in which you would like to create your project. It can be anywhere, but it's recommended that it be somewhere you can easily access. I create a folder on my desktop for each project.
 
 ```
 cd /c/Users/Desktop/<project_folder>
 ```
